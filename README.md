# FinalGroupProject

## Purpose
For a complete overview, please read this Google Docs: [Full Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17qE4EpPkiPzLPozuWUquXoIG7EHNouHkCWiLn5jvdzw/edit)
This was our final group project assignment for data structures. The purpose of this was to test which Software as a service (or SaaS) would be best on a given day for a company named Columbus Software Solutions (CSS) with lots of data to sort. The sorting solutions to choose from AJAX and ACME both have their pricing model.
### AJAX price model

### ACME price model

 Columbus Software Solutions also has a set amount of data it sorts per day; check below:

Our teacher wanted to create a technical report, which can be found in this link: [Technical Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rCjDQgEKEoDdsL_U9MxKd0B_-NJkKdjI6fL9T1vYdfY/edit).

## Usage
The program would ask the user which day it and give them the information needed. The output would provide the user the amount of data sorted on a given day, which Software as a service used, time to sort in milliseconds and seconds, and the total money cost. Depending on which day it is, it will take the program to complete. ACME sorting has a time complexity of O(n^2) and AJAX's time complexity is O(n log n).
