# AJAX and ACME Sorting Solutions

## Purpose
For a complete overview, please read this Google Docs: [Full Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17qE4EpPkiPzLPozuWUquXoIG7EHNouHkCWiLn5jvdzw/edit)
This was our final group project assignment for the data structures course. The purpose of this was to test which Software as a service (SaaS) would be best on a given day for a company named Columbus Software Solutions (CSS) with lots of data to sort. The sorting solutions to choose from AJAX and ACME have their pricing models.

### ACME price model

 Columbus Software Solutions also has a set amount of data it sorts per day; check below:

Our teacher wanted to create a technical report, which can be found in this link: [Technical Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rCjDQgEKEoDdsL_U9MxKd0B_-NJkKdjI6fL9T1vYdfY/edit).

## Usage
The program would ask the user which day it is and give them the information needed. The output would provide the user the amount of data sorted on a given day, which Software as a service used, time to sort in milliseconds and seconds, and the total money cost. Depending on which day it is, it will take the program longer to complete. ACME sorting has a time complexity of O(n^2) and AJAX's time complexity is O(n log n).
